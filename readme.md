CodeReview #5 for Backend Developer Course@Codefactory Vienna
==================================================================


You love animals and think it is time to adopt one. You like all sorts of animals: small animals, large animals, you may like reptiles and birds and may be open to adopting animals of any age. 
Let's then create an animal adoption platform to connect users (people interested in adopting pets) and animals (pets interested in being adopted). 

All users must introduce their first_name and last_name, email, phone_number, address, picture and password in order to register on the platform.
All animals must have a name, a photo and live at a specific location(a single line like “Praterstrasse 23” is enough). They also have a description, size, age, vaccinated, must belong to a breed and have a status "Adopted" or "Available".

For this CodeReview, you need to create a structure using PHP and MySQL (apart from HTML, CSS, JS, etc) that will display all data from the animals.


Purpose of this CodeReview:
- create a CRUD for a table
- create a loginsystem for users+admin
- control access to pages via the session
- create a filter for entries on one of the pages
